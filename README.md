# Capstone-Project-Topological-Data-Analysis
Extracted complex geometric features from retinal scans using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), subsequently employed in constructing a Random Forest classifier to assign 
disease severity grades to an unlabelled scan. Objective focused on developing a precise and interpretable model, leveraging these geometric features to identify the most
predictive regions within each photo, contributing to more precise treatment decisions for IIH patients.
